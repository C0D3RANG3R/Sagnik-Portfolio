      <p class="content">
        I’m a 23-year-old full stack developer from West Bengal, India, driven to craft meaningful digital experiences.
        My journey into technology began with a simple curiosity—wanting to understand what happens behind the scenes,
        from a webpage’s layout to the logic that powers an application.
        Over the last few years I’ve honed skills on both the frontend and backend.
        I build intuitive user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while engineering robust server-side logic with Java Spring Boot.
        Bridging design and functionality is where I thrive.
        Clean, maintainable code and thoughtful problem-solving are non-negotiables for me.
        I value collaboration, continuous learning, and steady improvement, bringing those principles into every project and team I join.
        Growing up in culturally rich West Bengal has given me an appreciation for creativity, balance, and storytelling—qualities I weave into the software I build.
        When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me exploring new tech trends, gaming, or relaxing with a cup of tea while sketching fresh ideas.
        I’m always eager to tackle new challenges, contribute to impactful projects, and grow alongside like-minded creators.
